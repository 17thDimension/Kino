Effects
-------

Currently Kino only provides the following three effects.

### Streak

**Streak** adds horizontally stretched bloom effects that roughly resembles
anamorphic lens flares. It's not based on physical characteristics of lens, nor
is not energy conserving, but handy to emphasize shininess in a few clicks.

### Recolor

**Recolor** gives false colors to renders based on luminance. It also supports
edge detection to add contour lines to them.

### Overlay

**Overlay** simply adds a color gradient to the final output of the post
process. It's handy to widen the color spectrum of final images in a nearly
unnoticeable level.
